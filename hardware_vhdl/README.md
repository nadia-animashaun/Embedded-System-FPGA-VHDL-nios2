# VHDL Hardware Modules

This directory contains the VHDL hardware components for the embedded system.

## Contents
- Processor core
- RAM and ROM modules
- Address decoder
- Register-level components
- System-level interconnect

## Purpose
These modules implement the hardware layer of the embedded system, enabling
memory-mapped I/O and communication with embedded firmware running on a soft-core
processor.

## Verification
System behavior is validated using VHDL testbenches to confirm correct address
decoding, memory access, and signal operation.
